<h2 align=center> Three Trends </h2>
<br>
<section>
<b> 1. Evolution of the Computer </b>
<p> The fundamental concepts of computing and calculation have been around for thousands of years. </p>
<p> Precomputers and Early Computers age before approximately 1946 which include archeological finds such as notched bones, knotted twine, hieroglyphics, and abacus considered the earliest calculating device. Other early computing devices include th slide rule, the mechanical calculator, and Dr. Herman Hollerith's Punch Card Tabulating Machine and Sorter. </p>
<p> First-Generation Computers were large occupying entire rooms and were powered by thousands of vacuum tubes. </p>
<p> Second-Generation Computers began when the transistor started to replace vacuum tubes which allowed computers to be smaller, less expensive, more powerful, more energy-efficent, and more reliable. </p>
<p> The Thrid-Generation Computers were marked by the beginning of integrated circuits. ICs included many transistors and electronic circuits on a single tiny silicon chip allowing computers to be even smaller. </p>
<p> Fourth-Generation Computers come from a breakthrough in the early 1970s which made it possible to place an increasing number of transistors on a single chip. This led to the invention of the microprocessor in 1971. </p>
<p> Fifth-Generation Computers are most commonly defined as those that are based on artificial intelligence, allowing them to think, reason, and learn. Some aspects of fifth-generation include voice and touch input and speech recognition. </p>

<b> 2. Computers in Your Life </b>
<p> Computers involve most aspects of your life. Computer usage range from at home, in education, on the job, and on the go. </p>
<p> Home computing has increased dramatically over the last few decades after computers and the Internet have become significantly more affordable and accessible. Computer usage at home involve refrencing; such as retrieving information, obtaining news, viewing recipes, online shopping, and checking your e-mail, producivty; editing and managing digital photos and home videos, paying bills, and work-related tasks, such as to review work-related documentd or check work e-mail from home, and entertainment; the delivery of photos, videos, music, games, TV shows, instant messages, and social networking updates. </p>
<p> Computers in education has shown relevant since most children and teens today have been exposed to computers. Today's youth can definitely be called the computing generation. Many schools today have computers and Internet access available in the classrom and a computer lab for student use. Many student can access the Internet from anywhere on campus to do research, check e-mail, and more cia a campus hotspot. Computers are also used to facilitate distance learning compared to physically going to class. </p>
<p> Computers are constently evolving on the job for years. Today, computers are used by all types of employees in all types of businesses. Computers are used for productivity, decision making, off-site communications, and authentication. </p>
<p> They are different types of computers in other aspects of day-to-day life. Many carry portable devices or smartphones with them at all times in order to stay in touch with others and access the Internet. Consumer kiosks, mobile payment systems and consumer authentication systems are other apects of on the go use. </p>

<b> 3. Computers and Society </b>
<p> The vast improvements in technology over the past decade have had a distinct impact, computers have become indispensable tools in our lives. </p>
<p> The benefits of a computer-oriented society are numerous. The capability to virtually design, build, and test new buildings, cars, and airplanes before the actual construction begins helps professionals create safer end products. Technological advances in medicine allow for earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment of diseases than ever before. In general, technology has also made a huge number of tasks in our lives go much faster.  </p>
<p> A computer-oriented society also comes with risks. A variety of problems have emerged from our extensive computer use, ranging from stress and health concerns, to the proliferation of spam (unsolicited e-mails) and malware (harmful programs that can be installed on our computers without our knowledge), to security and privacy issues, to legal and ethical dilemmas. </p>
<p> Security and privicy issues are risen with the increase in technology. One of the most common online security risks today is your computer becoming infected with a malware program, such as a computer virusâ€”a malicious software program designed alter how a computer functions. Malware frequently harms the infected machine by destroying data or slowing it down so it cannot perform correctly. Some individuals also view the potential risk to personal privacy as one of the most important issues regarding our networked society. As more and more data about our everyday activities is collected and stored on devices accessible via the Internet, our privacy is at risk because the potential for privacy violations increases. </p>
