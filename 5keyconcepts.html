<b> 4. Software vs. Hardware </b>
<p>The word "software" refers to the scripts or instructions that are utilised to direct the computer hardware. The software must typically be installed on a computer before use in any situation. Most software is bought on a CD or DVD, or it can be downloaded from the Internet. Additionally, software does not necessarily need to be installed on your computer in order to be used.
